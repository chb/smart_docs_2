<h3>Translating Between Coding Systems</h3>

<p>Chances are that your medical data is already encoded in one of the widely
available coding standards used in the medical community. When exposing your
data through the SMART API, you will have to provide data about the patient
using the coding systems defined by SMART (such as SNOMED-CT, RXNORM, LOINC,
etc). Therefore you will need to map your local data codes into the SMART
defined coding systems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the problem of generating accurate translations between coding
systems is an inexact science. Due to differences between the terminology
terms, it is often times not possible to derive a complete one-to-one map
between two systems to preclude loss of meaning as result of translation. A
good practice when generating SMART RDF with translated codes is to include
provenance information. Here is an example that specifies the provenance for a
lab result translation from a local labcode to LOINC:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;sp:labName&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;sp:CodedValue&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;sp:code</span> <span class="na">rdf:resource=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://loinc.org/codes/2951-2&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;dcterms:title&gt;</span>Serum sodium<span class="nt">&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;sp:codeProvenance&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;sp:CodeProvenance&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;sp:sourceCode</span> <span class="na">rdf:resource=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://local-emr/labcodes/01234&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;dcterms:title&gt;</span>Random blood sodium level<span class="nt">&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;sp:translationFidelity</span> <span class="na">rdf:resource=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://smartplatforms.org/terms/code/fidelity#automated&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/sp:CodeProvenance&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/sp:codeProvenance&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/sp:CodedValue&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/sp:labName&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For translating from one system to another, we highly recommend reusing
commonly available maps. For example, the US National Library of Medicine
provides maps for translation between ICD-9-CM and SNOMED-CT
(<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/icd9cmv3_to_snomedct.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/icd9cmv3_to_snomedct.html</a>,
<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/icd9cm_to_snomedct.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/icd9cm_to_snomedct.html</a>).</p>

<h3>RDF vs JSON</h3>

<p>RDF is the internal format in which SMART structures the patient records data.
A SMART server instance responds to REST API calls for medical data with RDF
serialized as RDF-XML. The XML data received from SMART is typically
non-deterministic in nature (i.e. it can change with each request on the same
data element, even when the underlying patient data remains constant). This is
because RDF-XML is a projection (flat representation) of a the RDF graph
structure expressing the patient record. In the SMART reference container the
patient RDF graph is stored in a specialized triple store engine. Because the
serialization of the RDF as RDF-XML is perfomed at the triple store level, it
is the result of the store&#39;s graph walk algorithm which favors speed over
predictive order of results. Thus, every time the RDF-XML is produced by the
server, it will be different from the preceeding runs.</p>

<p>Developers used to working with XML may be tempted to view the RDF-XML as a
typical XML payload and apply pattern recognition strategies (XPath, XQuery,
XSLT, etc) to extract data from it. Unfortunately, the non-deterministic
nature of this XML payload breaks the assumptions of these approaches
rendering them useless. The correct way to work with RDF-XML is to use an RDF
parser which reconstructs the patient graph in a data structure that can be
querried with SPARQL, the query language for RDF graphs. This approach
requires a non-cursory level of understanding of RDF that is not common
among developers.</p>

<p>As an alternative to RDF SMART, when using the SMART Connect JavaScript client
the SMART app developers have the option of fetching the patient data in JSON
format which is likely more familiar. One advantage of JSON over RDF is that
the JSON representation of the patient record is predictable (i.e.
deterministic). Also, by using the JSON structure available in the SMART
Connect client response objects, there is no need to learn SPARQL. The
disadvantage over RDF though is that the JSON object is not as well adapted to
use with logic reasoners as the RDF graph would be and also not as flexible to
extend. This said, developers should try both approaches and pick the one
which works better for their needs.</p>

<h3>Partial Implementations</h3>

<p>Implementing the complete SMART specification on top of your medical records
system will allow you and your system&#39;s users to run the full range of SMART
apps. However, a complete implementation may turn out to be a large scale
project.</p>

<p>In some cases, the desire to SMART enable a system is to support running
specific applications. In such cases, you may want to consider a partial
implementation of the SMART standard following the least common denominator
principle.</p>

<p>A useful feature for partial implementations are SMART &quot;container manifests&quot;.
Container manifests are discovery mechanism for SMART apps to learn the API
calls supported by a container. Apps do this by requesting the container
manifest through the <code>/manifest</code> REST path. For example, the public sandbox of
the SMART Platforms project exposes its manifest on the following URL:
<a href="http://sandbox-api.smartplatforms.org/manifest">http://sandbox-api.smartplatforms.org/manifest</a></p>

<p>Even if your end goal is complete SMART support, it may still be a good
strategy to start small and implement a few API calls and testing your
container with apps that rely on them. Since a majority of the SMART apps
currently available use the SMART Connect interface, it would make sense to
focus on implementing this interface before tackling the more involved SMART
REST interface which requires, among other things, implementing the OAuth
protocol.</p>

<p>Taking the incremental approach, a good strategy would be to start by
implementing the Demographics data model and API then moving to the
Medications, Problems, or VitalSigns data models and APIs.</p>

<h3>Reusing Portions of the SMART Reference Container</h3>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="reference-container.html">reference container</a> section,
the SMART Platforms team maintains an open-source medical record system that
implements the SMART specification. The reference container is available under
the Apache 2 open source license and can serve as a basis for rapid SMART
container implementations. One of the implementation strategies outlined in
the <a href="roadmap.html">roamap for container developers</a> is replacing the reference
contianer&#39;s data source and user authentication modules with an adapter to
your medical data systems. The downside of reusing the reference container
code is that it has not been tested in highly scalable environments and will
introduce dependencies on Python and Django-based code components.</p>

<h3>Extending the SMART API and Data Models</h3>

<p>While not a common practice, your SMART container implementation can extended
the SMART specification with new API calls and data models that support the
needs of your specific community. Apps written to take advantage of these
non-standard calls that need to run on a standard SMART container will need to
degrade gracefully in the absence of the extended API calls.</p>

<h2>Implementing Write Capabilities</h2>

<p>With the exception of the Clinical Notes, Preferences, and Scratchpad APIs,
the SMART standard does not provide for write functionality in the container.
Therefore the majority of the SMART apps presently available assume read-only
interactions with the container. However, as mentioned above, a container may
extend the standard API to provide non-standard write capabilities.</p>
