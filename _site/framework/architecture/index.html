          <h2>SMART Architecture Basics</h2>

<h3>The Three Basic Components of the SMART Architecture</h3>

<p>The first component of the SMART universe is the ecosystem of SMART
<em>applications</em> created by various software developers eager to bring solutions
in the hands of clinicians and patients. The apps could include a medication
manager, a diabetes evaluation suite, or perhaps a lab results visualizer.
These meaningful apps could be distributed via an app store.</p>

<p>Then we have the <em>containers</em> which play the role of data providers in the
SMART world. The containers could be personally controlled health records
systems, electronic medical records systems, health data exchanges, or other
providers. Either way, a container is responsible for exposing the SMART API to
the apps and providing a context in which the apps could run.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the <em>interface</em> which enables the apps and containers to talk
to each other using the SMART application programming interface (or API). The
API is what keeps the apps and the containers decoupled from each other
allowing the users to mix and match them.</p>

<p>Also, the API enables the substitutability of the SMART apps and containers.
From the perspective of an app the containers are substitutable, because they
all expose the same interface and the app can run on any one of them. Also from
the perspective of the container, the apps are substitutable. The container
administrator is free to pick the apps that he needs. And when a better app
comes along, he can replace the existing app with the new one.</p>

<p>In order to keep things simple, an app runs against one container at a time.
The container, however, is free to connect to multiple data sources and
aggregate data as needed.</p>

<h3>The Two SMART APIs: Connect and REST</h3>

<p>At the bottom of the diagram we have the front end of the container and the
smart application within a web browser window. The container and the app might
also have back end server components. For the container the back end component
might be an EMR system housing a large collection of medical records. The app
could have a back end that helps with elaborate visualizations, data mashing,
or other complex computations.</p>

<p>On front end components use an interface called SMART Connect to communicate
with each other right inside the browser environment. Using it the app can get
patient context from the container and execute API calls. The back end
components can also talk to each other. And for that they use an interface
called SMART REST.  Should an app choose to use the SMART REST interface, it
simply has to obtain an authentication token from the container using SMART
Connect, and pass it to the back end component, which can then use it to issue
SMART REST calls to the container&#39;s back end.</p>

<h3>Digging Into the Components</h3>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the elements that an app needs in order to provide a
meaningful service to the end user. First, the app needs a flexible,
standards-based UI that enables the user to interact with it. Next, the app
needs to have an authentication mechanism with the container to establish
trust. And last but not least, the app needs data in order to work with. The
data includes patient and provide context information, as well as medical
record elements such as medications and lab results. We will look at each one
of these components in more detail.</p>

<p>(TODO: insert diagram)</p>

<p>This diagram illustrates the container&#39;s UI component in a browser window. The
white portion of the screen is the UI that the container provides, which allow
the user to choose a patient and launch various SMART applications on his data.</p>

<p>The main portion of the screen real estate is taken by the SMART app. The app
is launched by the container in an IFRAME. An IFRAME is an in-browser mechanism
that enables multiple web pages to open up on the same screen. When launched
the app establishes a channel to the container using the SMART connect
JavaScript library. It can then issue SMART API calls such as &quot;GET MEDICATIONS&quot;
in order to obtain data from the container. Finally, the app displays the data
to the user and allows him to interact with it.</p>

<p>The next architectural piece is the authentication mechanism. Different EMR
systems have their own authentication schemes. In order to keep the app
agnostic to them, it is the container&#39;s responsibility to provide a standard
way for establishing trust. And for that SMART uses oAuth, which is an open web
standard for authentication. Thus the app does not have to deal with the
underlying system&#39;s permissions mechanisms. All it needs is to speak OAuth. The
container uses its internal logic to decide what the app can see and what is
forbidden.</p>

<p>The last component of the architecture is the medical data. And for that SMART
takes what we call an &quot;80/20&quot; approach. What this means is that we try to pick
the 20% of the fields out there that represent 80% of the data about the
patients. This selectivity of SMART is one thing that makes writing SMART apps
relatively easy. Also, SMART uses consistent best-of-the-breed coding systems
for representing medical facts within the SMART data models. For example for
medications we use RXNORM, for problems we use SNOMED, and labs are based on
LOINC. The SMART data payloads are expressed in RDF and are extensible.</p>
