<h2>What is SMART?</h2>

<p>SMART provides a unified mechanism for diverse applications to interact with
medical record data. <em>SMART Apps</em> built against the SMART API can be
embedded within any <em>SMART Container</em>. A SMART Container is, most often,
an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system used by physicians, but might also be
a Personal Health Record (PHR) such as <a href="http://indivohealth.org">Indivo</a> used
by patients, or a data-analytics platform such as <a href="https://www.i2b2.org">i2b2</a>
used by researchers.</p>

<p>For example, a SMART app might analyze a person&#39;s risk of heart disease based
on recent labs and demographic information. This app can then be deployed on
Regenstrief&#39;s CareWeb EHR, Children Hospital Boston&#39;s Indivo PCHR, or Harvard
Medical School&#39;s i2b2 analytics engine. As other EMR vendors adopt the SMART
platform, the app&#39;s reach increases <em>without changing a single line of code</em>.</p>

<p>A SMART app is a normal web application, embedded as a frame within the SMART
Container&#39;s user interface, with access to the SMART API for interacting with
health data. A patient, Penny, may use a medication browser app within her
PCHR. Meanwhile, a primary care doctor Dave may use the same app within his
clinic-based EMR to view the medications of a patient scheduled for an
appointment next week. Penny&#39;s PCHR and Dave&#39;s EMR are both SMART containers;
they both expose the SMART API; and they can both display the medication
browser app. Though they may function very differently behind the scenes, they
can both embed the exact same medication-list-manager app because they present
the same API. Importantly, in any given user session (Penny&#39;s or Dave&#39;s), the
medication-list-manager is connected to only &#39;&#39;one&#39;&#39; SMART container.</p>

<p>The screenshots to the right demonstrate the same medication list application
running in the context of two different SMART containers: a simplified EMR, and
the analytics platform i2b2.</p>

<p>A SMART app can access the SMART API in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>via &quot;SMART Connect&quot;, using Javascript calls from our client library</li>
<li>via &quot;SMART REST&quot;, using standard OAuth authentication and authorization
and simple REST calls to a SMART container</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these approaches can be used to get at the same underlying data. SMART
Connect is for simple applications whose logic can be completely built in HTML
and JavaScript. SMART REST is for applications that may need to perform
significant back-end processing, in particular when using additional external
data sources.</p>

<p>Whether you access data via SMART Connect, SMART REST, or a combination, your
app will load the <a href="/libraries/javascript/">SMART App Javascript Libraries</a>. In
the case of SMART Connect, this library is the sole access point. In the case
of SMART REST, the library provides the OAuth token handoff and medical-record
context, which your app can then send back to its back-end for use in REST
calls.</p>

<h2>SMART Connect</h2>

<p>Writing a purely browser-based app in HTML5 and JavaScript is as easy as
including the client-side JavaScript libraries and making API calls! Keep in
mind that SMART Connect calls can only access data while the end-user remains
online, since authentication depends on that user&#39;s existing session with the
SMART container. If your app needs to access data from your web application&#39;s
backend or while the user is offline, you&#39;ll need to make some REST calls as
well.</p>

<h2>SMART REST</h2>

<p>Apps with server-side requirements, or apps that need offline access to the
SMART API, use the REST interface, which exposes data as resources accessible
via HTTP GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. To ensure apps are authorized to access the
resources they request, the SMART container authenticates each REST API call
using OAuth, a scheme by which a SMART container or user may delegate access to
applications.</p>

<p>The delegation takes the form of a token/secret pair, generated by the SMART
container and handed off to the application (with permission!). After tokens
are obtained, each HTTP request is signed using the shared secret.</p>

<p>Writing a SMART REST app requires a bit more work than a SMART Connect app,
because the app must be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li> Interact with the SMART container using OAuth to obtain tokens</li>
<li> Store tokens securely, maintaining appropriate sessions</li>
<li> Select the appropriate token and sign each SMART REST API call</li>
</ol>

<p>To simplify the job of working with SMART REST, we provide client
libraries in <a href="/libraries/python">Python</a> and <a href="/libraries/java">Java</a></p>
