# SMART Developers Community

## Discussion Group

The best way to get in touch with fellow SMART developers, discuss SMART apps
and containers, ask questions, get help, or find out what others are thinking
about SMART is to join the [SMART App Developers
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/smart-app-developers).

## News and Events

Check out the [SMART web site](http://smartplatforms.org/). for news about
SMART, and to find out about any upcoming SMART community events and
conferences.
