#About This Guide

We wrote this guide with the developer who wants to get started developing
medical apps with SMART in mind. We will lead you through the process of setting up
your environment and implementing your first working SMART app that you
will test against the SMART reference container in the cloud. The tutorials
in thsi guide assume general software develoment skills but no prior familiarity
with SMART or medical informatics is necessary.

We recommend following the guide in sequential order.
